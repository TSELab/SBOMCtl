# SBOM data

This directory contains two sample collections of SBOMs, they are not strictly necessary for the project to work, but they are useful (e.g., for development and testing).

These are:

## guac-data

This is borrowed from the guac project, and is a collection of SBOM metadata writ-large. This includes SBOMs in SPDX and CylconeDX formats.

## bom-shelter

This is borrowed from the chainguard-dev project, and is a collection of SBOM metadata curated to test sbom compliance and accuracy. 
These were generated by running a series of SCA tools on selected projects.
